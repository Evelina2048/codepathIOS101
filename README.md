Color changing background and text app.

# Prework - Colorful

Submitted by: Evelina Guenther

Colorful is an app that, when the button is clicked, changes the color of the text and background

Time spent: 30 hours spent in total, I had a lot of issues getting Xcode to work, but XCode works now. I probably only spent a few hours of work outside of fixing issues with XCode.

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [ Yes ] Users are see a screen with three labels and a button
- [ Yes ] Tapping the button changes the screen color to a random color

## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

I wanted to do something behind the minimum requirements. So, I decided to change the font and made the text color change with the button clicks.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

When I would try to launch Xcode, I would keep getting errors, such as it saying that it quit unexpectedly. It worked once I started to close out all apps and tabs possible before launching the simulator.
